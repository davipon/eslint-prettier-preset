### 🛠 Usage

⚠️ Make sure your repository is initialized (`git init` or `git clone`) before you start.

```bash
# In your TS project
npx @preset/cli davipon/eslint-prettier-preset

# If this is your first time using @preset/cli, you'd be asked to install it first.
```

> This is not a template, but a preset to add integrations to your project.
